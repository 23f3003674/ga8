## Project Description
A Beeswarm Plot was generated to analyze employee salary distributions across various departments and experience levels. This visualization supports compensation analysis, pay equity evaluation, and executive reporting.

### Included Files
- **chart.png** — Beeswarm Plot exported from RAWGraphs (300–512 px)
- **data.csv** — Synthetic 20-row dataset of employee salaries
- **README.md** — Project documentation (this file)

### How the Visualization Was Created
1. Data was prepared in CSV format with the following columns:
   - `department`
   - `level`
   - `salary`
2. Data was imported into **RAWGraphs** (https://rawgraphs.io/).
3. The **Beeswarm Plot** chart type was selected.
4. Visual mappings:
   - *X-axis*: salary  
   - *Groups*: department  
   - *Color*: level
5. Style adjustments were applied for professional, publication-quality output.
6. The chart was exported as **chart.png** (within 300–512px).
